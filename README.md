# AWS Cloud Portfolio  

This repository is a hands-on showcase of real-world cloud solutions developed through AWS Cloud Quest.  
It reflects my practical experience across Data Analytics and Solutions Architecture, where I designed, deployed, and documented complete AWS projects that mirror production environments.

Each scenario demonstrates a full implementation cycle — from problem analysis and architecture design to deployment, testing, and optimization — following AWS best practices and operational standards.

## Scenarios  

1. **Data Lake & Data Catalog** – Built a secure and scalable data lake using Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Athena to centralize data and enable flexible querying.  
2. **Event-Driven ETL & Streaming Analytics** – Created an automated ETL pipeline triggered by S3 events, leveraging AWS Lambda and Kinesis for real-time data processing and analytics.  
3. **RESTful API with Lambda & DynamoDB** – Developed a serverless API using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB to deliver a lightweight, secure backend solution.  
4. **Containerized Microservices on ECS Fargate** – Deployed containerized microservices on AWS Fargate with load balancing and scaling for high availability and efficiency.

### About This Portfolio  

All scenarios were designed and tested within AWS Cloud Quest environments, then refined to emphasize the architecture, logic, and validation steps behind each solution.  
This portfolio demonstrates not only technical ability, but also the process of thinking through system design, identifying trade-offs, and documenting results with clarity and precision.
